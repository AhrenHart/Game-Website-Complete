            <h1 class="Title"> SURVIVE THE NIGHT GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="Header" >Abstract </p>
        <p class="Text" > Survive the night is a 2D game based around the idea of a monochromatic Gameboy game( different shades of green).Within survive the night the player will have a choice of three different levels cemetery, castle and standard arena. The aim for the player is to survive for  as long they can through different rounds with difficulty increasing as rounds increase, with different types of enemies and attacks. </p>
        <p class="Header" >Games Design </p>
        <p class="Header"  >Game Overview </p>
        <p class="Text"> The idea of the game that I will be creating for my website, is a 2D top down survival shooter which will have a multiple type of enemies and waves that the player will have to fend off. The working title of the game subject to change is “Survive the Night”. This type of game allows for an endless style of gameplay and will only end once the player has run out of lives (3 lives).  The game will be set within a “Arena” style area with the possibilities of 3 different maps to fit the theme of the game. These would be a cemetery, a basic arena area and a castle. The enemy types will be basic zombies, ranged zombies, faster zombies and AOE (Area of effect) zombies. The types of enemies will gradually change the higher the round and the longer the game goes on for.  </p>
        <p class="Header">Art and visual Design </p>
        <p class="Text"> The game itself will be set to a green monochromatic colour scheme to fit the theme of the website itself (An original Gameboy, seen in figure 1). I want the game to have a retro style theme, that makes the gamer feel nostalgic with the artistic style I am going for by matching the aesthetics of the original Gameboy games along with keeping the game at an 8-bit theme. The main reasoning on why the game is going to look the way it is, is because I have designed the game around the website first to get a rough idea of how I want it to look and feel. The reason behind the green monochrome colour scheme is due to the original Gameboy itself being limited to four different shades of green (Shown below in figure 2), which is what I’m going to keep to, in keep with my design aesthetic I am going for both game and website wise. </p>

        <p class="Header" >Gameplay </p>
        <p class="Text"> Within survive the night the player will have a choice of three different levels cemetery, castle and standard arena. The aim for the player is to survive for  as long they can through different rounds with difficulty increasing as rounds increase, with different types of enemies and attacks. The gameplay itself will be very basic, as in point and shoot. Whilst trying to survive as long as they can do whilst the levels get harder with the enemies changing with the use of ranged or AOE attacks.  </p>
        <p class="Header" >Game Features </p>
        <p class="Text">-Infinite amount of rounds</p>
        <p class="Text">-Higher the rounds the harder it gets (within limits)</p>
        <p class="Text" >-Different types of enemies</p>
        <p class="Text">-3 different levels to choose from</p>
        <p class="Text">-Player has 3 lives</p>
        <p class="Text">-Possibility of an enemy dropping an extra life Very slim chance</p>
        <p class="Header" >Inspirations </p>
        <p class="Text"> Survive the Night is a game that draws inspiration from many old school and new games. These being “Legend of Zelda”, “Pokemon” and new games such as “Binding of Isaac”, “Call of duty: Zombies” and “BoxHead zombies”. For A lot of these games they are very simple with controls as well with simple directional controls for shooting and moving and with it being a web-based game, I don’t want to make the controls to confusing like a normal console/pc game.  </p>
        <p class="Text"> When it comes to Pokemon and Legend of Zelda the game takes inspiration from the art style with both these being on the original Gameboy, which helps myself decided how I want to take the game art wise as it is in an 8-bit style. Expecially when I am limited by 4 different shades of the same colour it gets hard trying to make textures and sprites look different, This is why these two games are being used as inspiration due to them havening a limit range of colour but using it in a way which made it stylistic and easy to understand what everything is . In keeping with the Gameboy theme, I am also going to use 8-bit music either self-created or royalty free. </p>
        <p class="Text"> When it comes to why I’m making the game an arena style survival game it harkens back to when I played flash based games such as BoxHead Zombies which is a similar game I am wanting to make due to the simplicity of the game and the fun of trying to survive multiple waves of enemies. However, I am obviously changing some ideas and themes of the game so I wouldn’t be copying, these being the aesthetics, Enemy type and I’m keeping it simplistic sticking with one weapon instead of providing multiple types of weapons  </p>
        <p class="Text"> The game also takes a lot of ideas from Call of Duty zombies’ mode. As the rounds increase the number of zombies will increase along with the types of enemies that will spawn, which will gradually increase the difficulty for the player. The game will have Three different levels to choose from to keep it different, these being a cemetery, a basic arena area and a castle. I wanted to keep the gameplay simple like Call of Duty zombies as that’s a game where you don’t have to think too hard and just try to stay alive killing zombies, and you can waste hours just playing that even though you are doing the same thing repeatedly, but with the competitiveness of trying to see how many rounds you can survive.  </p>

        <p class="Header">Game Interface Design </p>
        <img src="Designpage Images/Initial_design_UI.png" height="250" width="250"/>
        <img src="images/Placeholder Images/Zombie image.png" height="250" width="250"/>
        <img src="images/Placeholder Images/Zombie Main Menu.png" height="250" width="250"/>
        <img src="images/Placeholder Images/Zombie pause menu.png" height="250" width="250"/>
        <img src="images/Placeholder Images/Zombie UI Overlay.png" height="250" width="250"/>
        <p class="Text"> When it came to UI, I wanted to keep it simplistic to not have the screen overflowing with UI and keep your focus on the game. Therefore, I designed the basic UI with your hearts down at the bottom, ammo and rounds at top left-hand corner and a pause button in the right or just hit esc to pause. I also wanted the main menu to look aesthetically pleasing and fitting with the original Gameboy menus; So, I designed the images above Pixelart.com to kept in theme with my game and left it ominous with shadows of zombies in a forest like setting. I did slightly differ from my colour scheme and had a few more shades of green but this was to allow slightly more detail. The same image shall be used for the main menu and the Pause menu. The pause menu will have options as return to game, Quit and reset the game back to first level.  </p>
        <p class="Header" >Game Implementation </p>
        <p class="Text">With the creation of the game I have decided to streamline some of the work to keep inline with Gantt chart time scale and due to the assets produced by “chasersgaming” (13) which keep in line with the theme I am going with I have decided to stick with them. The assets are free to be used within the public domain which is perfect for me and has no risk of any copyright infringement. The sprites also allow for a flexible and fluid animations for the sprites to keep the game looking aesthetically pleasing and not looking like a quickly made game with just static sprites following the character. </p>
        <p class="Header" >Players </p>
        <img src="Designpage Images/Player.png" height="300" width="300"/>
        <p class="Text">The main character of the game will just be a basic solder to keep in theme with the game along with it being fitting as the main way you protect yourself in the game will be shooting a gun. Along with the Sprite being provided “chasersgaming” who has provided a punch of different spire poses which allows for a fluid animation system and not just having a static sprite moving across the canvas.</p>
        <p class="Header">Enemies </p>
        <img src="Designpage Images/Enemy 1.png" height="300" width="300"/>
        <img src="Designpage Images/Enemy 2.png" height="300" width="300"/>
        <img src="Designpage Images/Enemy 3.png" height="300" width="300"/>
        <p class="Text">When it came to the characters that would be in the game I thought it would be smart to only have a handful to keep the workload low along with keeping the game simple and easy to work with without overcomplicating it, with a lot of mobs. Even though there is one model for the Zombie there is a varying amount of attacking types of enemy there are. Within the game there are technically 2 different types of enemies; Slow zombies and fast zombies. The Vigilante will be slightly reworked to look more zombie like and will be more of a “brute” style that will have more health than a standard zombie to keep the sprites identifiable. The Monster style zombie will be a turret style monster that sends projectiles out to the player that you have to dodge, otherwise it will deal damage. </p>

        <img src="Designpage Images/Tileset1.png" height="300" width="300"/>
        <img src="Designpage Images/Tileset2.png" height="300" width="300"/>

        <img src="Designpage Images/Tileset4.png" height="300" width="300"/>
        <p class="Text">As mentioned above shall be using the tile sets by “chasersgaming” which allows me to capture the aesthetic style I want within the game. But also, with the tile sets above it allows me to easily create the 3 main levels (cemetery, castle and standard arena.) with decent detail akin to what you would have seen in the original Gameboy games. However, if I do need an extra asset for the levels, I at least have a basic idea on what they should look like due to having the premade assets. </p>

        <p class="Header" >Music and Sound Effects</p>
        <p class="Text">Within the game due to the different environments there is a need for different sounds to fit with the given environments. Even though this is a web game and not to the scale of most traditional games, sound design this is one of the most important parts of a game as a bad choice of sound design can make a player lose immersion; along with a game with no sound can be rather boring.  </p>
        <p class="Text"> The importance of not just background music but just basic sound effects are integral for the style of game I am trying to produce due to it being a homage of original Gameboy games which made do with what limited technology it had and still made it enjoyable. </p>
        <p class="Text"> As stated by Ernest Adams “The Sound and especially the music, will contribute greatly to this. Think hard about the kind of music you want and consider what genres will be appropriate. Stanley Kubrick listened to hundreds of records to select the music for 2001: A Space odyssey, and he astonished the world with his choice of “the Blue Danube” for the shuttle docking sequence “ (12)</p>
